# 5 - Setup ACR

Containers are great, but how do we use them for deployment?

## Challenge
  - Building and Pushing Images
  - Now that you are sure the application works, the team must ensure that all of the components are built as Docker images and pushed to the team's Azure Container Registry (ACR).

## Success Criteria
  - Your team  must have built images and pushed them to the team's ACR. Share your understanding of how each of the images were built and pushed to the registry with your coach.
